Q:
Lesson 14: Networking

A:


Q:
What do you call the process of networks interconnecting

A:
--> inter-networking

Q:
What are individual computers called in a network? What do they connect to?
A:
--> Nodes, Hosts

Q: 
What is the most important characteristic for each application?

Video streaming: 
Online Gaming: 
Server admin: 
Piracy: 

A:
Video streaming: bandwith / many users / quality
Online Gaming: Latency (packets) / packet loss
Server admin: Encryption / network access (groups) / firewalls
Piracy: Distrubuted network (no single point of failure) , redundantancy

Q: 
T/F, is www the same as the internet?

A:
--> F : www is a client server architechture not the internet

Q: 
Describe each section on the right and left of the point 'www.mcgill.ca'

A:
        www.mcgill.ca
  client ^        ^server

Q: 
Why is piracy sites difficult to shut down?

A:
--> There aren't any central servers that host the pirated data, the data is distributed widely

Q: 
What is the idea behind packet switching? Describe how packet switching works in 2 steps

A:
Idea is to send a message

1st : divide data into fixed sized bundles of data ex: 1500 bytes,
Comes with metadata: where it came from, length, number

2nd: These bundles are passed through routers until it gets to its destination

Then it arrives to its final destination

Q:
How do routers know how to foward the packet?
A:
--> They look at the header of the packet (metadata)

Q:
What does the metadata of a packet include?
A:
--> The source and destination of the packet

Q:
Can circuit switched networks send data before it knows the path?
A:
--> No it can only do so when the path is set up

Q: 
Can packet switching networks send data before it knows the path?
A:
--> Yes it can

Q:
Which layer do the packets come into?
A:
--> The Network layer

Q: 
How many layers are in computer networking models like IP and TCP?
A:
--> 4 seperate layers

Q: 
Which layer are applications programmed against?
A:
--> The transport layer

Q: 
Which layer does the OS handle?
A:
--> The Network layer

Q:
What are the 4 layers of networking?
A:
--> link, network, transport, application

Q:
What does the protocol of a network establish?
A:
--> The Protocol: establishes which transport layer protocol is used, ie: how to package the data

Q:
What does a ip address look like, how do types relate to ? 
A:
--> ex: 142.251.42.46 : int.int.int.int where each int is from range 0-255, and separated by dots

Q: 
What is an example of an intermediate network device?

A:
--> a Router

Q: 
Are ip addresses globally unique?

A:
--> Only in routers are they globablly unique.

Q: 
Explain what gossiping is

A:
--> Where every router is saying to another:
"I know where these addresses are, and how many jumps are needed for your data to get to a address I have"

Q: 
What data structure do routers use to know where to send packets?

A:
--> Routing table: expresses, for a given range of destination addesses, where a packet should be sent to next.

Q: 
Why is IP unreliable? Give 2 examples

A:
--> It does not gaurentee message delivery
- messages could be lost entirely or corrupted during transit.
- messages could arrive out of order at the destination.

Q: 
How does TCP establish a connection oriented approach?

A:
--> Endpoints in a network first establish a connection by a special back and forth exchange of IP packets. (circuit switching 'path needs to exist first').

Q: 
On what layer is TCP implemented for you?

A:
--> on the OS layer.

Q: 
How does TCP choose the size of packets?

A:
--> It doesn't care, because it doesn't break up the data, it sends it in a continuous stream of bytes.

Q: 
How does TCP improve the data loss problem that is present in IP?

A:
--> It send acknowledgement messages that confirm the receipt of data. Any loss or corruption is detected, if so packets are resent.

Q: 
What is the relationship between two devices with TCP?

A:
--> One is a client, one is a server

Q: 
What are the 3 procedural steps of TCP?

A:
1. The server starts listening for incoming connections.
2. A client requests to connect to a listening server. 
3. The server accepts (or rejects) the incoming connection.

Q: 
What is the three way handshake?

A:
1. server **listens**
2. client **requests to connect** to that server
3. server **accepts** (or rejects) incoming connection

Q: 
Give an example of the three-way handshake.

A:
Server "listening..."
Client "I would like to connect"
Server "Okay no problem" or "Nope not today bud." , Client "Okay great!"

Q: 
What does UDP stand for?

A:
--> User datagram Protocol

Q: 
What does TCP stand for?

A:
--> Transmission Control Protocol

Q: 
What is a port?

A:
--> First your ip address is kinda like a cable box/ dvd player/ TV. Ports are like different channles that you plug into, like HDMI1 HDMI2, channel1, channel2, etc.

Q: 
What is the port number for ssh?

A:
--> port : 22  

Q: 
What is the port number for http or web traffic?

A:
--> port : 80

Q: 
What is the port number for https (http-secure) or encrypted web traffic?

A:
--> port : 443

Q: 
What range of port numbers are reserved?

A:
--> ports 0 - 1024

Q: 
What is the entire range of port numbers?
A:
--> 
0 - 1024 ----- 10k --------- 64k
reserved - okay to use - dont use these

Q: Do IP all packets travel allong the same path?

A:
--> No they use packet switching so they use what path is there at the time, each packet is orginized at the destination.

Q: ----- THE END -----

A:
Bye!
