Q:
----- Part I----- 

A:
INFOSEC

Q:
What are the three pillars of the CIA triad?

A:
- Confidentiality: unauthorized users cannot access information.
- Integrity: information is not lost or corrupted, and is protected from unauthorized modification
- Availability: authorized users can access information.

Q: 
T/F if nobody can access data is it secure?

A:
--> F : this violates the pillar of availability, the data needs to be accessible to auth'd users

Q: 
What pillar does TCP try to reinforce?

A:
--> The integrity pillar, because TCP aims to improve reliability of data transferred.

Q:
Which pillar does encryption affect?
A:
--> Integrity: encrypted connection stops during-travel tampering
--> Confidentiality: Encrypted connection to email server stops digital eavesdropping

Q:
Give 2 examples of confidentiality
A:
--> Encryption of physical data: Even if a attacker has your hard drive, the data is encrypted so they cant read it.
--> Access control policies: login credentials and 2FA are needed for users to access email server


Q:
Give 2 examples of Integrity

A:
--> Redundant data design: multiple servers that host piracy websites, if one goes down others replace it
--> 


Q:
Give 2 examples of Availability
A:
--> You can login from anywhere to see your emails

Q:
What is the cornerstone of infosec?
A:
--> Cryptographic methods ie: encryption

Q:
What is the definition of Cryptography?
A:
--> “Cryptography” refers to the practice of ensuring secure communications in the presence of adversarial behaviour.

Q:
----- Part II----- 

A:
Cryptography

Q:
What is Cyphertext? Can it be read by anyone?

A:
--> encrypted plaintext, No it cannot be read by anyone, it can only be read/decoded if the person has the decryption key.

Q:
Do you trust intermediate nodes ie: middlemen?
A:
--> No they are untrustworthy.

Q:
Which pillars do middlemen threaten?
A:
--> confidentiality and integrity

Q:
If Alice and Bob want to communicate, how would Eve exploit a confidentiality vulnerability?
A:
--> Eve could snoop on a undecrypted line of communication.

Q:
If Alice and Bob want to communicate, how would Eve exploit a Integrity vulnerability?
A:
--> Eve could insert herself on a encrypted and unsigned line of communication and act like she is Bob or Alice.


Q:
How can you tell that you are sending an encrypted message to the person you think?
A:
--> By signing the messages that you both send.

Q:
What does this sentence say? "Khoor, krz duh brx?" 
How did you find out?

A:
K --> H 
h --> e 
o --> l
o --> l
r --> o
--> "Hello, how are you", Shift the letters backwards by 3 

Q:
What is the difference between symmetric and unsymmetric encryption algos?
A:
--> Symmetric both parties have the a common secret key
--> Unsymmetric: both parties have unique secret keys

Q: 
Describe the Diffie-Hellman key exchange

A:
1. Two parties start with a common 'paint colour'
2. They each have a secret colour that the mix with the common one
3. Both send the mixed colour over a unsecure channel to each other.
4. They add their secret colour to the partners mixed colour.
5. This derives a shared common secrete colour.

Q:
What problem does the Diffie-Hellman key exchange attempt to solve?
A:
--> This solves the confidentially problem of deriving a secret key.

Q:
What is TLS?
A:
--> A protocol that establishes how 2 parties communicating over TCP encrypt their data.
- TLS can use Diffie-Hellman to establish a shared secret key. 
- TLS can use AES with that shared secret to protect confidentiality.

Q:
T/F TLS is sufficient enough to protect against fraud.
A:
--> F: phising attacks, someone can impersonate a site, then go through entire TLS protocol, and attack users this way.

Q:
What is a checksum?
A:
--> A calculation done on a message that produces some kind of summary, the checksum is included in the message itself

Q:
By who is the checksum used and for what purpose?
A:
--> The receiver of the message performs the same calculation on the message, and compares with the bundled checksum.

Q:
What is indicated if the checksum fails?
A:
--> The receiver knows that the data was corrupted

Q:
What Algorithm is used in credit cards to check if the number is valid?
A:
Luhn’s algorithm
-The last digit of a credit card is actually a kind of checksum!
-This is to mitigate data entry errors (typos), not fraud.

Q:
What is Luhn's algorithim?
A:
Starting from the first digit, double every other digit in the card number
-If the result of doubling is longer than 1 digit, add the two digits together
-Sum all the digits together
-If the result is divisible by 10, the card number is valid

Q:
T/F hashes cannot be reversed
A:
--> True, and it is infeasible to find a random input str that produces a target hash

Q:
What is a MAC?
A:
--> A message authentication code (MAC) 
--> Essentially an unforgeable checksum.

Q:
If two parties have a pre-shared key how can they create a MAC (message auth'd code)
A:
--> By using cryptographic hash functions

Q:
Describe the 4 steps to create a MAC from a pre-shared key.
A:
- Append the preshared key to the end of the message to send.
- Compute the hash of the resulting augmented message.
- Send the original message together with the hash.
- The receiver appends the preshared key to the end of the message, hashes, and compares with the provided hash

Q:
Fill in the blanks:

Sender does: ____ + shared _____ ---- _____ ---> MAC. 

Then sends: _____ + _____ ---> 

Receiver gets: msg + _____, then does: msg + shared ____ ---> ____. 

If receiver finds that their ____ == sent _____ , then all good.

A:
Sender does: msg + shared key ---- Hash ---> MAC. 

Then sends: Hash + msg --->

Receiver gets: msg + Hash, then does: msg + shared key ---> Hash.

If receiver finds that their Hash == sent hash, then all good.


Q: 
What to do when presharing keys is unfeasablie?

A:
--> Use asymmetric cryptography.


Q:
What is an example of asymmetric cryptography?
A:
--> RSA algo


Q:
What is the meaning of 'm','e','d','%' in this formula?

(m^e)^d % n == m

A:
m: message
e: Public key
d: Private key
%: Modulo


Q:
With RSA, If the owner of a private key sends out a chipertext message, who can read it?
A:
--> Anyone with the public key can decrypt then read the plaintext.

Q:
What does PKI stand for?
A:
--> Public Key infrastructure

Q:
What is the idea behind PKI?
A:
--> Problem, have to get public keys for every website ever...
Idea: delegate trust to specific authorities (certificate authorities)


Q:
What does google's servers send you when you try to connect?
A:
-The server presents its public key together with a message authentication code signed by a certificate authority.
-Your operating system ensures that you have the public keys of the certificate authorities
