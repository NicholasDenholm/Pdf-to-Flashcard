Lec 2: Data and Control Structures in C

A:
__________________________________________
Part 1

Variables

Q:
List the 4 basic types

A:

--> char
--> int
--> float
--> double

Q:
What are the size of the 4 basic types

--> char : 4 bytes
--> int : 8 bytes
--> float : 32 bytes
--> double : 2x float : 64 bytes
--> void : means no type

Q:
What is the difference between floats and doubles?

A:

--> floats have 6 digit precision and range is from: (1.18路10^-38 to 3.40路10^38)
--> double have double the size of the float, the range is (2.23路10^-308 to 1.80路10^308) with 15 digits of precision.


Q:
Implement a bool type using int in C

A:
--> Use typedef int bool;

typedef int bool;
const int true = 1;
const int false = 0;
bool isValid = false;

Q:
What is the difference between a signed int and a long int?

A:

--> a signed int has a min bit size of 16 with a range of -32,768 - 32,767, and a long has 32 bits with a range of -2,147,483,648 - 2,147,483,648.


Q:
How does bit size change with modifiers unsigned , short, long, long long?

A:

--> unsigned is only Natural numbers, signed numbers can be -ve as well.


Q:
How do you make the terminal produce a noise and flash?

A:

--> you put \a as a escape character


Q:
What is the range of a unsigned char?

A:

--> 0 to 255

Q:
How do you get the size of a type?

A:

--> sizeof(int), sizeof(char), etc.

Q:
How do compiliers follow type sizes?

A:

--> They follow minimum size requirments.
--> On a 16-bit machine, short is typically 16 bits, int is 16 bits,
and long is 32 bits
--> On a 64-bit machine, short is typically 16 bits, int is 32 bits,
and long is 64 bits (mimi is 64 bits)

Q:
What are the 4 derived data types?

A:

--> Arrays
--> Structures
--> Pointers
--> Unions

Q:
Describe the 4 derived data types.

A:

--> Arrays: Combine items with the same type
--> Structures: Combine items with different types
--> Pointer: Address to an object in memory
--> Unions: Combine items with different types but holding only one value at a time.


Q:
How can you represent a str in C?

A:

--> They are either char* : char pointer to a char type, or char[] : array of characters.

Q:
How to ensure that variables once initialized cannot be changed?

A:


--> use the 'const' declariations
ex: int const A = 1;

Q:
How to make a custom type?

A:

--> use typedef
ex:

typedef int scale;
int main() {
        scale a;
        a = 10;
        printf("%s\n", a);
}

Q:
Convert this statement into code: if A smaller than B or C mod B equals 0 and not C equal to A.
        increment A
        Decrement B
        Divide C by B
        Multiply A by C


A:

if (A < B || (C % B == 0 && !(C == A))) {
        // Condition is true
        A =+;
        B =-;
        C /= B;
        A *= C;
}


Q:
How would you write True and false conditional expressions?

A:

--> (CONDITION) ? TRUE_EXPRESSION : FALSE_EXPRESSION;
ex: z = (y < 10) ? x++ : x--; // assume x = 5 and y = 2



Q:
What does x equal to in these examples?

// assume x = 5 and y = 2
x = x + y++;
x = x + ++y;

A:

--> x=7 , y=3
--> x=8 , y=3

Q:
Does this do anything? if (5) puts("hello");

A:

--> yes, any non 0 value is considered true, so it will print hello


Q:
How do you increment a char? ex: go from A - D?

A:

char x = 'A';
char x + 3;
// char are ints as well

Q:
How do you link a library using the compilier?

A:

--> gcc -l
-lm : link math

Q:

Part 2: C Control Structures

A:

Q:
How do you write a if else statment in C? Give examples for single condition and multiple conditions

A:
// if (CONDITION) SINGLE_STATEMENT; else SINGLE_STATEMENT;

if (x < 10) puts("X is less than 10\n");
else puts("X is greater than 10\n");

or for multiple statments:

// if (CONDITION) { MULTIPLE_STATEMENTS; }
// else {MULTIPLE_STATEMENTS;}

if (x < 10) {
        puts("X is less than 10\n");
        c = getc(stdin);
} else {
        puts("X is greater than 10\n");
}


Q:
How could you use the switch variable to do differing functions based off of arguments A,B,C?

A:

switch(argv[0]){
        case A: //DO_THIS
                break;
        case B: //DO_THIS
                break;
        case C: //DO_THIS
                break;
        default:
                //DO_THIS
}

Q:
Implement a yes no input from a user. How would you handle upper and lower cases?

A:

char = inp
do {
        puts("Do you wish to continue Y / N ");
        inp = getc(stdin);
} while (inp != 'Y' || inp != 'N');

switch(inp){
        case Y:
                puts("Yes selected");
                break;
        case N:
                puts("No selected");
                break;
        default:
                puts("Error");
                break
}

Q:
What does this output?

int x;
for(x=0; x<10; x++) puts("Hi!");

A:

--> Hi 10 times

Q:
What does this output?

int x, y;
char c;
for(x=0, y=10, c=' '; x<10 && c != 'x'; x+=2, y--) {
        puts("Hi");
        c = getc(stdin);
}

A:

--> The user has 5 attempts at guessing the value of x, if incorrect this prints Hi.
